# GRV - The Generalised RV (GRV) Test

This is an R package version of the standalone GRV R scripts provided at https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana/grv.html.  The R package was created with minimal efforts such that the package passes `R CMD check --as-cran` using the GRV authors' example script as a package test.

_Disclaimer: I have not intention maintaining this R package beyond my own needs._
